# CRUD_DB_Dashboard
In order to use this dashboard, you would need to have an existing MySQL DB with the same format as the one our original class utilized. You will also need to download the *_streamlit_* python package. Once you have these dependencies, follow the directions below.

## Instructions to run:

1. open a command prompt at the folder location

2. type streamlit run crud.py

3. The page will open in a browser and you will be able to interact with the "project2" database

## Video Demos
Please check out the video demos to see how the project is intended to work. Please excuse the dialog as the original audience was my professor for my CSE 5720 course.
